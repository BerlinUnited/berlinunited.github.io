======================
First install the pip dependencies  
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Local Development
To run the website locally run:
`mkdocs serve`

## Add pages
TODO

Example for building own plugins:

---

## Deployment
TODO: explain CI here. This makes gh-deploy unnecessary

To deploy the website to github pages run:
`mkdocs gh-deploy`

This will modify the branch `gh-pages` and push it, which in turn we trigger github to show the new website.
