======================
First install the pip dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the website locally run:
`mkdocs serve`

To deploy the website to github pages run:
`mkdocs gh-deploy`

This will modify the branch `gh-pages` and push it, which in turn we trigger gitlab to show the new website.
