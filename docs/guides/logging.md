# Logging 

you can control the logging folder via the logDirPath parameter from the gamelogger module. The default is "/tmp". 
This parameter applies to the game.log and image log that are written automatically. This does not apply for manually recorded logfiles with robotcontrol.


TODO add image from robotcontrol here
