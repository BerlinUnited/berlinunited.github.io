	filter several problems can arise. One difficulty is to obtain error
	models for the sensors and for the state transitions. The other difficulty
	is to find an adequate compromise between the accuracy of the belief
	probability distribution and the computational costs that are needed
	to update it. In this paper we show how a short-term memory of perceptions
	and actions can be used to calculate the state. In contrast to the
	Bayesian filter, this method does not need an internal representation
	of the state which is updated by the sensor and motion information.
	It is shown that this is especially useful when information of sparse
	sensors (sensors with non-unique measurements with respect of the
	state) has to be integrated.},

abstract = {Strategic positioning is a decisive part of the team play within a
soccer game. In most solutions the positioning techniques are treated
as a constituent of a complete team play strategy. In a comprehensive
overview we discuss the team play and positioning methods used within
RoboCup and extract the essential requirements for player positioning.
In this work, we propose an approach for strategic positioning allowing
for flexible formulation of arbitrary strategies. Based on the conditions
of a specific strategy, the field is subdivided in regions by a Voronoi
tessellation and each region is assigned a weight. Those weights
influence the calculation of the optimal robot position as well as
the path. A team play strategy can be expressed by the choice of
the tessellation as well as the choice of the weights. This provides
a powerful abstraction layer simplifying the design of the actual
play strategy. We also present an implementation of an example strategy
based on this approach and analyse the performance of our approach
in simulation.},

  year      = {2016},
  abstract  = {This paper introduces a method for making fast decisions in a highly
dynamic situation, based on forward simulation. This approach is
inspired by the decision problem within the RoboCup domain. In this
environment, selecting the right action is often a challenging task.
The outcome of a particular action may depend on a wide variety of
environmental factors, such as the robot's position on the field
or the location of obstacles. In addition, the perception is often
heterogeneous, uncertain, and incomplete. In this context, we investigate
forward simulation as a versatile and extensible yet simple mechanism
for inference of decisions. The outcome of each possible action is
simulated based on the estimated state of the situation. The simulation
of a single action is split into a number of simple deterministic
simulations -- samples -- based on the uncertainties of the estimated
state and of the action model. Each of the samples is then evaluated
separately, and the evaluations are combined and compared with those
of other actions to inform the overall decision. This allows us to
effectively combine heterogeneous perceptual data, calculate a stable
decision, and reason about its uncertainty. This approach is implemented
for the kick selection task in the RoboCup SPL environment and is
actively used in competitions. We present analysis of real game data
showing significant improvement over our previous methods.},

  abstract  = {Conducting games in RoboCup incurs high cost in terms of effort, time, and money. The scientific outcome, however, is quite limited and often not very conclusive. Especially, analyzing and drawing conclusions about the performance of complex processes like decision making of an individual robot or the behavior on the team level poses a considerable challenge. Collecting more data during the competition games will help to analyze the performance of algorithms, identify errors and areas for improvement, and make more signiffcant statements regarding the performance of the robots. In this work we investigate the possibilities for collection of the large scale RoboCup data and its analysis. We present a system for automatic recording of synchronized videos of RoboCup games and an application for exploration and annotation of large sets of RoboCup-related data. We also present data sets collected during the competitions in 2018 and an algorithm for visual detection and tracking of robots in the RoboCup videos. A first empirical evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates how such data can be integrated and used to validate robot's behavior.},
